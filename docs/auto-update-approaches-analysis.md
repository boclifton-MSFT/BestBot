# Auto-Update Approaches for Language Documentation

## Executive Summary

The BestBot server (formerly BestPracticesMcp) currently serves static markdown files containing best practices for various programming languages. As languages evolve, these best practices need periodic updates to remain current and authoritative. This document analyzes different approaches for automating the update process while maintaining quality, consistency, and reliability.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Content Structure
- **16 supported languages** with dedicated markdown files
- **Authoritative sources** referenced in each file (e.g., Python PEPs, Oracle Java docs, OWASP guidelines)
- **Process-wide file caching** with 5-minute TTL and file modification detection
- **Azure Functions-based** MCP server with individual tools per language

### Update Frequency Requirements
- **Language specifications**: Quarterly to annually (major versions, LTS releases)
- **Security guidelines**: Monthly to quarterly (vulnerability discoveries, new attack patterns)
- **Framework updates**: Monthly to bi-annually (framework-specific best practices)
- **Tooling changes**: Quarterly (new linters, formatters, testing frameworks)

## Approach 1: Timer-Triggered Azure Function

### Implementation
```csharp
[Function("UpdateLanguagePractices")]
public async Task UpdateLanguagePractices([TimerTrigger("0 0 2 * * MON")] TimerInfo timer)
{
    // Weekly Monday 2 AM execution
    foreach (var language in SupportedLanguages)
    {
        await UpdateLanguageContent(language);
    }
}
```

  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  update-content:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Update Language Content
        uses: ./.github/actions/ai-content-updater
        with:
          languages: 'python,java,csharp'
          approval-required: true
```

            "minutes": [0],
            "weekDays": ["Monday"]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "actions": {
      "ForEach_Language": {
        "type": "Foreach",
        "items": "@variables('SupportedLanguages')",
        "actions": {
          "Check_Source_Updates": "...",
          "Update_Content": "...",
