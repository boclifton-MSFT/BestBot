# Flutter Best Practices

A concise, opinionated checklist for writing maintainable, performant, and secure Flutter applications. These practices are based on official Flutter documentation, Dart language guides, and proven patterns from the Flutter community.

## Quick checklist

- Follow official Dart style guide and use automated formatting with `dart format`.
- Organize project structure using feature-based folder hierarchy.
- Use meaningful widget and class names that describe their purpose.
- Prefer stateless widgets when state management isn't needed for better performance.
- Implement proper state management patterns (Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, or GetX).
- Always dispose controllers, streams, and listeners to prevent memory leaks.
- Use const constructors wherever possible to optimize widget rebuilds.
- Handle asynchronous operations with proper error handling and loading states.
- Implement responsive design using MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, and flexible widgets.
- Write widget tests, unit tests, and integration tests for critical functionality.

## When to use Flutter

Flutter is ideal for:
- Cross-platform mobile applications (iOS and Android) with native performance
- Desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux) with modern UI
- Web applications requiring rich, interactive user interfaces
- MVP/prototype development with rapid iteration cycles
- Teams wanting to share code across multiple platforms
- Applications requiring custom UI designs and animations
- Projects where development velocity and time-to-market are critical

Consider alternatives when:
- Building platform-specific apps that heavily rely on native APIs
- Creating simple web applications where Flutter Web might be overkill
- Working with teams exclusively familiar with native development
- Developing apps with minimal UI requirements where native solutions are sufficient

## Tooling and Ecosystem

### Development Environment
- **Flutter SDK**: Latest stable channel for production, beta for testing new features
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter SDK
- **IDE Support**: VS Code with Flutter extension, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA
- **Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` regularly to verify environment setup

### Package Management
- **pub.dev**: Official package repository for Flutter and Dart
- **pubspec.yaml**: Dependency management file
- **Version Constraints**: Use semantic versioning constraints (^1.2.3)

### Essential Tools
- **Flutter Inspector**: Widget debugging and layout inspection
- **Dart DevTools**: Performance profiling and debugging
- **Hot Reload**: Instant code changes during development
- **Hot Restart**: Full app restart while preserving debugging session

## Formatting and Linting

### Automatic Formatting
```bash
# Format all Dart files
dart format .

# Format specific file
dart format lib/main.dart

# Check if formatting is needed (CI/CD)
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
```

### Linting Configuration
Create `analysis_options.yaml` in project root:
```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude:
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
  
linter:
  rules:
    prefer_const_constructors: true
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: true
    avoid_unnecessary_containers: true
    sized_box_for_whitespace: true
    use_key_in_widget_constructors: true
```

### VS Code Settings
```json
{
  "dart.lineLength": 80,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "dart.closingLabels": true,
  "dart.previewFlutterUiGuides": true
}
```

---

## Testing and CI

### Testing Structure
```
test/
├── unit/           # Business logic tests
├── widget/         # Widget tests
└── integration/    # End-to-end tests
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget/my_widget_test.dart
```

### CI Configuration Example (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.16.0'
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
      - run: flutter analyze
      - run: flutter test --coverage
```

---

## Packaging and Release

### Android Release
```bash
# Generate release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Generate App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS Release
```bash
# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Build IPA for App Store
flutter build ipa --release
```

### Web Release
```bash
# Build for web
flutter build web --release
```

### Version Management
Update `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0+1  # version+build_number
```

---

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
- Use Flutter Secure Storage for sensitive data (tokens, credentials)
- Implement certificate pinning for network requests
- Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
- Use HTTPS for all network communications

### Code Security
- Obfuscate release builds: `flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=debug-info/`
- Avoid storing secrets in source code; use environment variables
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Regular dependency audits: `flutter pub deps`

### Platform Security
- Configure proper app permissions in Android and iOS
- Implement biometric authentication where appropriate
- Use encrypted databases for local data storage
- Regular security testing and penetration testing

---

## Recommended Libraries

### State Management
- **Provider**: Simple and lightweight state management
- **Bloc/Cubit**: Predictable state management with clear data flow
- **Riverpod**: Provider with compile-time safety and better testing
- **GetX**: All-in-one solution for state, route, and dependency management

### Networking
- **http**: Basic HTTP client for simple requests
- **dio**: Advanced HTTP client with interceptors and extensive features
- **retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client with code generation

### UI Components
- **flutter_bloc**: Reactive programming with BLoC pattern
- **cached_network_image**: Efficient image loading and caching
- **flutter_svg**: SVG image support
- **auto_route**: Code generation for routing

### Utilities
- **shared_preferences**: Simple key-value storage
- **path_provider**: Access to commonly used locations on filesystem
- **permission_handler**: Runtime permission management
- **device_info_plus**: Device information access

## Minimal Example

### Hello World App
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Build and Test CI Example
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run static analysis
flutter analyze

# Format code
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .

# Run tests
flutter test

# Build for release
flutter build apk --release
```
